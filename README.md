#AccountServiceApp

This is a AccountService working on a SpringBoot Rest Api, you can create, access and find accounts as well as transfer money between them.

I've used the Money And Currency Api (https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=354) to get a solid implementation of Money objects in the service. The Api is capable of converting currencies and keeping track of large sums with addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
